# Word Searcher
## What is it?
Word searcher is a C# application that allows users to load a folder full of files and search for a word or a sequence of words. The program will display the files that the respective word is contained into, and it will also highlight the position of it.

## Why though?
I needed to create a program for one of my uni classes which would benefit from multi-threading (or even multi-processing). This was the best I could.

## What was used to create it?
* Visual Studio 2022
* Windows Forms (with .net Framework)
* Tasks
* WindowsAPI for the file dialog section
